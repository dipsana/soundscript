# 🔐 Security Policy

## 📦 Project Name: SoundScript

**Version:** v1.0.1  
**Status:** Stable Production Release  
**Architecture:** Fully Client-Side, CDN-Powered

---

## 🛡️ Overview

SoundScript is a **fully client-side, CDN-powered music streaming application**.  
It contains **no backend servers, no authentication layers, and no remote code execution paths**.

All logic executes in the browser, and all media is served via a static CDN.  
Because of this architecture, SoundScript is **inherently resistant to server-side attack vectors**.

## 🔒 Data Handling

| Data Type        | Storage Location | Notes                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Play counts      | LocalStorage     | Stored locally on user device |
| Likes / Dislikes | LocalStorage     | Never transmitted externally  |
| UI State         | LocalStorage     | Session-persistent            |
| Audio / Images   | CDN (static)     | Read‑only, cache‑safe         |

**No personal information, credentials, or user identifiers are collected.**

## 🌐 CDN Security

SoundScript uses a **read‑only static CDN** (`soundscript‑cdn`) for:

* MP3 audio files
* Album artwork
* Artist images
* Metadata JSON

CDN assets:

* Contain no executable scripts
* Are immutable between versions
* Cannot modify application behavior

---

## 🧱 Client-Side Isolation

* No cookies are used
* No session tokens are generated
* No background network polling
* No WebSocket connections
* No dynamic remote script injection

This eliminates risks of:

* XSS via remote payloads
* CSRF
* Session hijacking
* Account data leakage

---

## ⚠️ Known Security Boundaries

* **LocalStorage data is not encrypted** — though it contains only non-sensitive playback stats.
* **CDN content is public** — anyone with the CDN URL can access media files.
* **No HTTPS enforcement** — though strongly recommended for production use.
* **Browser extensions** could potentially interfere with or observe playback state.

## 🐞 Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue:

* Open a GitHub Issue labeled **security**
* Or contact the maintainer directly

Please include:

* Description of the issue
* Steps to reproduce
* Browser & device information

All valid security reports will be reviewed promptly.

## 📈 Future Security Scope

Planned future upgrades may introduce:

* Authentication
* User profiles
* Backend APIs

If that happens, a new security policy will be issued with:

* Auth hardening
* API rate limiting
* Token handling rules

---

## 🏁 Final Note

SoundScript v1.0.1 is a **closed‑surface static client architecture** —  
meaning its attack surface is intentionally minimal.

Your data stays on your device.  
Your music stays on the CDN.  
No trackers. No accounts. No exposure.
